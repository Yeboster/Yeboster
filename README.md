Hi!

Let me introduce myself: I'm a web developer enthusiast (even if the web is a mess ðŸ˜›) and I like experimenting with new technologies.

Currently, I am learning [Phoenix framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org) (yes, I'm in love with functional programming) and studying [AI at the University of Trieste](https://ai.units.it/en).

You can also check my [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/Yeboster) (yes, I'm lazy to transfer the repositories).

If you'd like to contribute or you want to contact me, you can [send me an email](mailto:yeboster@gmail.com).

Have a nice day!

**Hi**! I hope you're doing well.

Let me introduce myself: I'm a web developer enthusiast (even if the web is a mess ðŸ˜›) and I like experimenting with new technologies.

Currently, I am learning [Phoenix framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org) (yes, I'm in love with functional programming).

You can also check my [Gitlab](https://gitlab.com/Yeboster) (also yes, I'm lazy to transfer the repositories).

Have a nice day!
